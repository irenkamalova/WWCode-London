<br><br>
Interviewing is a skill that improves with practice. You never want your first interview to be for the job you want the most. In order to ensure you have had some practice before it really counts, Women Who Code London is proud to launch the Mock Behavioral Interview Program for all our members to hone their interviewing skills.
<br><br>

A mock interview gives you practice answering interview questions in a realistic setting where you are under a bit of pressure. It‚Äôs only about 30 minutes, but that‚Äôs enough time to force you to think on your feet. Most important, mock interviews are designed to provide feedback and allow for improvement.

Who is this program for?
- Anyone who is looking for a job and wants to hone their interviewing skills by practicing in a supportive environment
- Anyone who would be willing to help conduct interviews with candidates and provide feedback. Mock Interviews offer an excellent opportunity to highlight your commitment to the community and also train your own interviewer skills. Interviewers will be provided with full support and resources to conduct interviews and provide feedback.

  <br><br>
For our July Book Club, Women Who Code London will be reading and discussing ‚ÄúQuiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking" by Susan Cain.
<br><br>

How can you measure or define someone's personality? One way is to figure out where a person falls on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Want to know where on the spectrum you are? Come join us at the book club and see how you can learn about:

- Can one be an extroverted introvert and vice versa?
- Why do extroverts often have it easier?
- How can the particular skills of introverts and extroverts be of use to achieve excellence?
